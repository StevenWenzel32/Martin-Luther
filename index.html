    <h2> Things that I'm working on coding </h2>
    <p> I really like coding
    notice that spacing doesn't really matter
    everything is printed on one line on the page
    even though everything in the code is on seperate lines
    <p> If you want a new line, you need to use another paragrapgh of tag
    <p> See.
